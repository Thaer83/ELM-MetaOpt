.. note::
  If you want to understand how Metaheuristic is applied to Extreme Learning Machine, you need to read the paper
  titled "A Metaheuristic Optimization Approach for Extreme Learning Machine". The paper can be accessed at the
  following `this link <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2020.03.063>`_


Please include these citations if you plan to use this library::
