.. note::
  If you want to understand how Metaheuristic is applied to Extreme Learning Machine, you need to read the paper
  titled "A new workload prediction model using extreme learning machine and enhanced tug of war optimization".
  The paper can be accessed at the following `this link <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2020.03.063>`_


Please include these citations if you plan to use this library::
